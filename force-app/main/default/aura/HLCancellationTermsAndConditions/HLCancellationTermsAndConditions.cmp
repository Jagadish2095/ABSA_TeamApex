        <br/><br/>
        <p>•	The borrower will need to give us at least 90 days’ notice of your intention to cancel your bond to avoid any early termination fees.</p>
        <br/>
        <p>•	If a borrower want to cancel a loan but has not given notice as required, interest will be charged for the 90 days’ notice period.</p>
        <br/>
        <p>•	The amount that the customer will be charged will be the difference between 90 days and the number of days that expired between cancellation figures being issued and when cancellation takes place, both days included</p>
        <br/>
        <p>•	The Notice of Cancellation is valid for 6 months.</p>
        <br/>
        <p>•	If your bond is not cancelled within 6 months, you will be required to renew Notice of Cancellation.</p>
        <br/>
        <p>•	The initial request for cancellation figures will also serve as the date on which notice is given, unless Absa is in possession of an earlier notice date. The cancellation figure will include provision for the additional interest payable.</p>
        <br/>
        <p>•	Should the Conveyancer “stop” the cancellation process for any reason after the 6 month period, the 90 days’ notice hold will drop off the system if this hold was not placed prior to cancellation figures requested.</p>
        <br/>
        <p>•	If the Conveyancer requests cancellation figures on the same "stopped" account, the 90 day’ notice period will start from the new cancellation figure date and not automatically from the previous date. </p>
        <br/>
        <p>•	Attorneys to provide Absa with the information in order to avoid charging early termination fee on the new figures, by keeping proof and submitting to the Cancellations Department prior to stopping the cancellation on e4.</p>
        <br/>
        <p>•	Should the customer give 90 days’ notice and cancellation figures are not issued within this period, the customer will have to give Absa new instructions.  </p>
        <br/>
        <p>•	Legal Fees – if there are litigation proceedings then a provisional litigation fee may be added to your balance. </p>
